1 - Overview

The BBTools Code Library is a collection of classes, functions, methods, and formulas created to make the prototyping and design of game design easier. You don't need to reinvent the wheel everytime that we game designers need to make a prototype or solve a problem, in BBTools I have created a variety of calculators, scripts, and dlls to make your life easier when it comes to design, so you don't have to focus on the tedium of reinventing the wheel and can focus on making good games.
